    Intrinsic: CharacterData

    Sets character data of a group.

    Declaration:
        :intrinsic CharacterData(~G::Grp, Data::Tup : Check:=false)

    Parameters:
       G - A group.
       Data - 3-Tuple with character data.

    Options:
       Check - If set to +true+, then characters are checked. Check is +false+ by default.

    Description:
        With this intrinsic the character data (conjugacy classes, irreducible complex characters, and names of these characters) can be set at once to the attributes <Grp.Classes>, <Grp.CharacterTable>, and <Grp.CharacterNames> of +G+. It is used for importing character tables from CHEVIE for example to preserve CHEVIE's labeling. The point is that although we can use Magma's +AssignClasses+ function to manually set the conjugacy classes internally, the resulting list will usually be *resorted* so that we cannot afterwards import our character table! That's why we implemented this function which does all this at the same time by computing the column permutation caused by Magma's internal resort and then rearranging our given character table.

        +G+ can be any group and +Data+ is a 3-tuple giving the character data in the following form
            * The first component is a system of representatives of the conjugacy classes of +G+ (see below).
            * The second component is the character table with respect to the given conjugacy classes.
            * The third component are names for the characters.

        The conjugacy classes (first component of +Data+) can be given in a variety of forms
            * As a sequence of elements of +G+.
            * As a sequence of integer sequences descibing presentations of elements of +G+ in its generators.
            * As a sequence of 2-tuples consisting of an element of +G+ as above and the class length of this element.
            * As a sequence of 2-tuples consisting of an integer sequence as above and the class length of the corresponding element.

        <Grp.ClassMap> is automatically assigned. If the representatives were given as words (as for example in case of the CHEVIE data), then these words are also stored in <Grp.ClassWords>. If the option +Check+ is set to +true+, then it is checked whether the given characters are indeed characters and irreducible. This option is +false+ by default.
